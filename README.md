# A1-split
Haskell function named splitit. It is to take a list of any type, split it in half, and return
the two halves in a new list. If there are an odd number of elements, the first half is to be
the smaller one. This implies that if there is only one element, the first list of the two should
be empty. If the input is the empty list, the output list should contain a pair of empty lists.
The input list can contain any type of element, including numbers, characters, strings, lists,
etc.
